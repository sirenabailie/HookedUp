# HookedUp Backend API

HookedUp is a backend RESTful API built with **ASP.NET Core 8** and **Entity Framework Core** that powers a platform for matching clients and artists on project requests, reviews, messaging, and user management. It offers full CRUD functionality across multiple resources with an in-memory database for testing and easy horizontal scalability.

---

## Ideal User

HookedUp is designed for creative project coordinators, freelance artists, and clients who need a centralized system to:

* Submit and track project requests
* Manage artist profiles and portfolios
* Leave ratings and reviews for completed work
* Communicate directly via messaging
* Handle user registration and roles

Whether you’re an art director coordinating assignments or a freelancer showcasing your expertise, HookedUp simplifies collaboration and feedback.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HookedUp.git  
cd HookedUp
```

### 2. Configure the Database

HookedUp uses SQLite by default for simplicity. In `appsettings.json`, ensure you have:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=hookedup.db"
}
```

For production, swap to PostgreSQL or SQL Server:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=...;Port=...;Database=HookedUp;Username=...;Password=..."
}
```

### 3. Apply Migrations & Run

```bash
cd HookedUp
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
```

## Unit Testing

Unit tests use **xUnit**, **FluentAssertions**, and EF Core InMemory to verify CRUD operations for each resource:

```bash
cd HookedUp.Tests
dotnet test
```

Test coverage includes:

*  Create, read, update, delete flows for all endpoints
*  Model validation and HTTP status codes
*  Isolation with in-memory database

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **.NET 8.0** with Minimal APIs
* **Entity Framework Core** (InMemory + SQLite/PostgreSQL)
* **Swagger/OpenAPI** for interactive documentation
* **xUnit** + **FluentAssertions** for testing

---

## 🛡️ Future Improvements

* Authentication & role-based authorization
* Pagination, filtering, and sorting
* Full-text search on descriptions
* File storage for images (S3, Azure Blob)
